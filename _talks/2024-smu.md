# Post45

## Conferences
  - [annual faculty and graduate conferences](https://post45.org/conferences/)
  - works-in-progress symposia, pre-circulated papers, in-depth engagement
  - Prof. Pergadia and I participated in & organized grad conferences 2017-2020 (Berkeley/Stanford, Yale, Michigan/MSU, Princeton/Rutgers)
  - Met some good friends and colleagues (some of whom we've now been in a writing group with for ~7 years: Alexander Manshel, Laura B. McGrath, Sam Huber, and Anna Shechtman)

  - Highly recommended
    - submitting an abstract for the Post45 Graduate Conference ($0 registration, often includes a small stipend to help offset travel costs). Updates available at [X.com/Post_45](X.com/Post_45) or [https://post45.org/conferences/](https://post45.org/conferences/).
    - keeping an eye out for a CFP for a large Post45 conference in 2025/2026 (currently completing a proposal for the Huntington Library in Pasadena, CA to host and sponsor)

## *Post45: Contemporaries*
- Online forum for timely clusters on contemporary literature, art, media, and culture (shorter pieces, more experimental, not peer-reviewed)
- Some highlights:
  - one of Lauren Berlant's final publications, "[The Traumic: On BoJack Horseman's 'Good Damage](https://post45.org/2020/11/the-traumic-on-bojack-horsemans-good-damage/),'" in the "[Leaving Hollywoo: Essays After BoJack Horseman](https://post45.org/sections/contemporaries-essays/bojack-horseman/)" cluster (2020) 
  - [*Slow Burn* 1: The Neapolitan Novels](https://post45.org/2015/06/the-slow-burn-an-introduction/) an epistolary cluster (exchange of letters) among four scholars on Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels, which later became *The Ferrante Letters: An Experiment in Collective Criticism* by Sarah Chihaya, Merve Emre, Katherine Hill, and Juno Jill Richards, an award-winning book published by Columbia University Press.

# *Post45 Journal*
- Began as copy editor (& web developer) -> managing editor -> co-editor with Annie McClanahan (UC Irvine)
- Can talk more about the responsibilities of each editorial role, but as co-editors, Annie and I lead the review & publication processes: soliciting submissions, desk reviewing articles, deciding who to invite to peer review pieces, making decisions & providing guidance to authors about revisions, 

## Distinctive features of *Post45 Journal*
- "Diamond Open Access"
- Online-only
  - No backlog = faster time-to-publication
- Thorough copy editing
- Independently published / scholar-led
- (mention pros & cons of these properties)
