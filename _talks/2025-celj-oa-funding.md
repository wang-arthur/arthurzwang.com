Talk on funding models for [<i class="fa-regular fa-gem" aria-hidden="true"></i>Diamond Open Access](https://scienceeurope.org/our-priorities/open-science/diamond-open-access/) journal publishing.


# Online Publication Formats

## Traditional
- No fees for authors, but paywalls/fees for readers
  - typically via institutional subscriptions
  - sometimes via individual subscriptions (e.g., subscription to *PMLA* bundled with MLA membership)
  - rarely via fees for accessing individual articles
- Examples: most journals! *ASAP/Journal*, *PMLA*, *GLQ*, *Postmodern Culture* (online-only but subscription-based)
- Access Concerns: excludes some readers (those without institutional affiliation or affiliation with institutions with limited resources/subscriptions)

## Green Open Access
- Self-archiving
- Examples
  - institutional repositories
  - arXiv.org
  - academia.edu
  - posting PDFs on a personal website
- Access Concerns: many publishers don't allow this or impose embargoes. Also risk of bypassing or devaluing editorial work?

## Gold OA
- No fees for readers, but fees for authors (Article Processing Charges or APCs, typically over $1000)
- Until recently, dominant model and priority for OA publishing
- Examples: some in the humanities, but much more common in the sciences (grant funding can be allocated to APCs)
- Access Concerns: Eliminates barriers for readers, but adds new ones for authors
  - The [Compact for OA Publishing Equity (COPE)](http://www.oacompact.org/signatories/) initiative tried to address these barriers by advocating for academic employers to pledge to cover these costs, but as the list of [signatories](http://www.oacompact.org/signatories/) suggests, the program primarily benefitted scholars affiliated with the wealthiest unviersities.


## Diamond OA
- No fees for anyone: where does the money come from???
- Examples:
  - Fully Diamond OA: [*Post45 Journal*](https://post45.org/journal/), [*liquid blackness*](https://liquidblackness.com/lb-journal)
  - Sections / Issues: [*Modernism/modernity Print Plus*](https://modernismmodernity.org/) & *Journal of Cinema and Media Studies* (*JCMS*)'s "[Fifth Issue](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jcms/oa-issue/)"
- Shift to OA
  - Biden White House (led by scholar Alondra Nelson, then Deputy Director for Science and Society) announced that federally-funded research papers must be published open access beginning in 2026 (policy now wiped from whitehouse.gov, but available on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20230307093527/https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf)), though not necessarily diamond OA.
  - [cOAlition S and Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/) and Science Europe's [Action Plan for Diamond Open Access](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-resources/action-plan-for-diamond-open-access/)

# Diamond OA Funding Models
## Individual Sponsorships
- Examples: *Post45 Journal* at Emory
- Issues: single point of failure, risk of cuts

## Community/Collective Fundraising
- Examples: [Open Access Community Investment Program (OACIP), Lyrasis](https://lyrasis.org/oacip/)

## "Flipping" Journals to Diamond OA
- focuses on changing publication format (rather than sustaining existing OA or launching new OA)

### "Subscribe to Open" schemes (hybrid / partial Diamond OA)
- Example: [Project MUSE S2O Initiative](https://about.muse.jhu.edu/subscribe-to-open/S2O)
- ![](https://about.muse.jhu.edu/media/uploads/subscribe_to_open/subscribe_to_open_process.png)

### Flipping to Open Access
- Example: [MIT Press shift+OPEN](https://mitpress.mit.edu/shiftopen/)
  > The MIT Press welcomes applications for shift+OPEN, our new program designed to flip existing subscription-based journals to a diamond open access publishing model. Launched with generous funding from the Arcadia Fund and expanded with funding from the National Science Foundation, shift+OPEN seeks to catalyze needed change in journals publishing, introduce authors to new readerships, and increase the reach of vital scholarship that has previously been locked behind paywalls.
- [Arcadia Fund](https://arcadiafund.org.uk/funding-areas/open-access) is a family charitable foundation, founded by Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin & one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the UK & one of the largest funders of open access initiatives, including the Wikimedia Foundation. The fund is not open to applications and seems to fund only large grants.
- Flipping to OA depends on grants or offsets/subsidies via portfolios of subscription/closed-access journals

### Experimental Formats
- Browser Extension for readers to add funds to a wallet, then "tip" Diamond OA publishers whenever they read an article
