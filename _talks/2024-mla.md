# "Rethinking Animal Comparison" Working Group (January 5-7, 2024)
Co-organized by me and Samantha Pergadia.

## Brief Description

What does it mean to be treated like an animal? This working group builds on recent studies of racialized dehumanization and of animality as a resource for minoritarian critique, resistance, and creation to synthesize and generate new theories of human-animal comparison across race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, feminist science and technology studies, and literary history.
