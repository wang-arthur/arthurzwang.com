# How and Why We Use Notion
## Pre-Notion System
- **Email** for corresponding with authors and guest editors
- **MailChimp** for newsletters
- **Slack** for internal editorial communication
- **Trello** for article tracking / submissions management
- **Google Sheets** for recordkeeping & history
- **Google Drive** for file management
- **Problems with this setup**
  - Contact list disorganized
  - Problems with recordkeeping
    - Details about past submissions, editorial process lost in long email threads
    - Google Sheet was always missing information / out of date, because we only used it for recordkeeping (and it duplicated information we more actively used in Trello)

## What is Notion?
- About Notion
  - “All-in-one workspace,” cloud-based software
- create documents and wikis
- links between documents
- collections of documents (data tables/boards to organize documents based on metadata)
  - ⁠many of our documents are “empty” (metadata only)
- ⁠additional features: 
  - ⁠integrations with other services (e.g., Slack, Google Drive)
  - basic automations (e.g., send notifications when certain metadata fields chang, e.g., when the managing editor adds a reader's report or links it to an article)

## Why and how do we use it?
- **Free** (Education+ Plan)
- We use it to organize and consolidate most of our information & data
  - people
    - authors
    - guest editors
    - peer reviewers
  - reader's reports
  - articles (review process)
  - articles (copy editing and production process)
  - other projects and tasks
- Data tables are **linked**
- helps keep us organized (due dates, single place to leave notes on article)
- Easy to sort, filter, and query / compile stats
  - use cases that weren't possible with our old system:
    - searching for potential peer reviewers
    - Identifying trends / patterns in our timelines

## Our Setup
  - Main Databases
    - Peer Review (Articles)
    - Copy Editing (Articles)
    - People (Authors, Reviewers, and Editors)
  - Additional Databases
    - Special Issues
    - Reader's Reports
    - Tasks/Projects

# Limitations
1. Lack of granular access, privacy, and permissions controls (databases are all-or-nothing) (summary of the issue + compilation of complaints / requests: https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/comments/173q38a/notions_missing_piece_database_views_access/)
   1. sharing status with special issue editors?
   2. adding a form for submissions (would be ideal if we could provide permissions for authors to view the status of their articles -- we can only share entire databases or nothing).
2. Notifications limited, but can use integrations
3. Online only (cloud service could be hacked, they could make a major error, or the company could go under abruptly, losing all data) -- no auto-backup or export. Should run a backup / download periodically!

# Alternatives / Competitors
- AirTable (education discount, but no free plan)
- Obsidian (free and more customizable, but requires more configuration & is mostly designed for individual rather than collaborative/team use)
- Trello (great for tasks, but less flexible)
- Google Sheets (our previous system)
- Commercial Submissions Management: most are unaffordable for individual journals (publishers can negotiate volume/enterprise discounts)
  - Scholastica: $425 per year plus $10 per submission
  - Submittable: $10K / year
  - Editorial Manager & ScholarOne (non-transparent pricing, must book a demo / talk to their sales team for a quote)
    - ScholarOne / Manuscript Central (according to a 2009 source) is at least $3500/year + $2000 startup fee
    - Editorial Manager is $5000/year
