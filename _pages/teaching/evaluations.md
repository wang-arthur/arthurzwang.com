## Narrative Responses
### Accessibility and Care
-   I really appreciated how deeply Professor Wang cared about all of
    our opinions and went above and beyond to make sure that all
    students felt welcomed, supported, and valued. It was clear how much
    effort and thought he put into all of our readings to foster growth
    and deep critical thinking. I always felt so listened to and
    supported throughout the course, especially in office hours.
-   Dr. Wang is a fantastic instructor. His ability to address sensitive
    issues in the subject matter with tact whilst deeply diving into the
    theories around the same is truly remarkable.
-   Very thoughtful and kind professor. Creates a safe class environment
    for open and thought-provoking discussion. Appreciate the blend of
    assignments (commonplace book, project, readings, etc.) and class
    activities aligned with the week\'s material. Really enjoyed my
    experience in Professor Wang\'s class and would take a class with
    him again.
-   I really appreciated Arthur\'s approach to universal design in
    class. His class policies on attendance, lateness, and participation
    felt very supportive of us as students and as people. The class
    environment overall felt relaxed and engaged. The professor was very
    welcoming of student topic additions to the syllabus. He also
    provided a lot of detailed support on how to work with different
    media and academic resources as we worked on our final projects.
-   Arthur is great and he spoke about everything with care and
    consideration. Each week was interesting and valuable conversations
    were had with everyone. It was emotional sometimes but everyone was
    very kind throughout.
-   Wonderful instructor. Gave extensive feedback on everyone\'s project
    proposals so that they could submit good finals. Listened to what
    the class wanted to study more. One week we were allowed to choose
    between a unit on trauma and a unit on horror. He took a democratic
    approach and let us vote. Always responds to emails efficiently. I
    appreciate that he is consistently thinking of universal design.
    Super friendly and kind to get to know. Always advertised office
    hours and provided access to course materials.

### Feedback and Growth
-   Arthur was a great instructor (for this class especially, with his
    software engineering/English background). He always came very
    prepared to class and asked some thought-provoking questions. In our
    conferences outside of class, Arthur provided very clear feedback.
    He let me know what he thought would work, but gave me the liberty
    to choose what would make sense for my work.
-   Arthur was really supportive of my research process and writing
    throughout the course, and I really appreciated the thorough
    preparation he put into the classes he led. He was passionate about
    the topic and themes of the course, and he facilitated great
    discussions during seminar.
-   Arthur is excellent at giving feedback on drafts, and his one-on-one
    office hours have greatly helped me to connect disparate ideas and
    give structure to my writing thought processes. He is extremely
    encouraging and insightful, and he constantly pushes us to improve
    our writing with respect to our individual skill levels.
-   Arthur is incredible!!! He was so helpful when I met with him for my
    papers and encouraged me to explore new ideas and push my thinking
    further. He was very engaged in section also and facilitated great
    conversation.

### Leading Discussions
-   Arthur is very strong in facilitating discussion and introducing
    points to continue to open new avenues of exploration during
    section. His feedback on papers and assignments was also incredibly
    helpful and thorough. He could improve his teaching by organizing
    section a little more tightly, to ensure that all portions of the
    section are allotted sufficient time, though he improved upon this
    over time as the course progressed.
-   Arthur was an awesome TA. He brought in interesting creative
    activities and lectures on supplemental content that made sections
    more than the reading regurgitation they often become. I really
    looked forward to each section. He was also really helpful when it
    came to giving feedback on ideas for the essays.
-   Arthur was incredibly dedicated, helpful and never failed to bring a
    novel approach to conceptualize the material. He was always very
    positive and created a great environment for debate and questioning.
    His energy and personality made me excited to come to section every
    week!
