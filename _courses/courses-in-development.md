# Thinking Software
**Histories, Theories, and Practices of Programming and Artificial Intelligence**
## Course Description

What do computing and thinking have in common? Can computer programs
understand, learn, and exercise creativity? How and when does software
curtail, limit, replace, and deaden human thought---and alternatively,
can software enable, accommodate, amplify, and democratize it?

This course investigates "thinking software" in two linked senses: its
topic is artificial intelligence (software that "thinks") and its
approach emphasizes critical and interdisciplinary engagements with
programming (thinking with and about software). Students will develop
skills as technological practitioner-theorists and gain proficiency in
analyzing, designing, and applying forms of artificial intelligence and
"thinking software." Topics include the limits of computation
(computability, computational complexity); openness, secrecy, and
cryptography; models and metaphors of artificial intelligence (e.g.
neural networks); theories of nonhuman intelligence before and beyond
computation (e.g. animal learning, "the wisdom of the crowd"); textual
data in natural language processing and machine learning; and approaches
to thinking about, measuring, and communicating the environmental,
economic, and ethical risks and costs of AI through data visualization,
description, and speculative narrative.

AI enthusiasts, skeptics, and the undecided are all welcome in this
course. Regardless of orientation, students will develop the
foundational knowledge and skills to reason about software and
artificial intelligence beyond the imprecise generalizations and
caricatures that sometimes appear in AI hype and condemnation alike.
Assignments will include a final project and biweekly problem sets
including both programming exercises and writing and design prompts. No
prior programming experience is required.

# Recent Feminist Futures 

## Course Description

This course examines science fiction as part of a feminist and queer tradition of forecasting, anticipating, and imagining other worlds: worlds without patriarchy and with alternative configurations of race, gender, sexuality, and power. We’ll consider feminist and queer utopias, dystopias, and heterotopias, with a special focus on the work of minoritized writers, artists, and intellectuals who have responded to histories of dehumanization not by asserting their essential humanity and claim to human rights, but by developing rich appropriations and transformations of animality, automatism, alienness, and deviance. 

We will read feminist science fiction as lessons in reading science and fiction as feminists.

# Theory, Violence, and Consent
## Course Description

This course surveys theories *of* sexual violence interrogating the relationship between theory *and* sexual violence. How does theory -- literary, critical, media, feminist, critical race, queer, film -- subtend, develop, or trouble the concepts and frameworks we depend on to adjudicate sexual violence? In this seminar, we will consider how the constellation of heterogeneous intellectual formations called "theory" have shaped and challenged contemporary discourses of sexual violence. We begin by considering how challenges and revisions to the ideas of the human and the subject demonstrate the affordances and limitations of consent as a demarcation of sexual harm. We then consider how mediation represents and perpetuates harm through feminist media, literary, and film theory. Finally, we explore alternatives to legalistic and carceral justice, and the challenges of imagining and representing recovery and reparation following world-destroying acts of violence in the macro-scales of war and trauma.

## Course Content Note

Throughout the semester, we will read and view texts that involve disturbing content, including sexual assault and racial violence. Please familiarize yourself with the texts in advance to determine if a particular session might generate a response that requires additional accommodation. You are permitted to use your allotted absences to excuse yourself from these sessions without providing any explanation or notice. If you are a survivor of any of these forms of violence, I am sorry this has happened to you. I will post a list of resources and support services for survivors and allies, both within and outside of the university. 

In order to maintain an inclusive academic environment, I ask that survivors of sexual assault avoid sharing details of their personal experience, as this may have the unintended effect of triggering other students. Given the statistical likelihood that there will be survivors among us, please refrain from any victim-blaming language. This course demands a community of free and open exchange, which requires that we respect the well-being and perspectives of all students. On top of these basic principles, in an early class meeting, we will discuss and formulate some additional community standards as a group, and revisit these midway through the semester for additions and revisions.

# The Humanities and the Human Sciences

## Course Description
What is human nature? And to whom does this question belong: biologists or philosophers? Readers or computer scientists? This seminar will consider the organization of intellectual inquiry and its histories.

# Introduction to Graduate Studies: Genres of Academic Work and Life 

**PhD Proseminar, could be adapted for MA**

## Course Description
This introduction to graduate studies in the humanities aims to fill common gaps in graduate education, ensuring that no one falls through the cracks. The course will prepare students for both graduate school and academic life beyond this institution. While some proseminars survey schools, methods, theories, or major directions in a field, this seminar dispenses with content and focuses instead on equipping students with essential skills, habits, and practices for navigating academic life and work.

This seminar will introduce professional genres, shibboleths, and conventions that are crucial for academic survival and success, but that graduate students are often expected to acquire by osmosis, from one-on-one mentoring, or through other informal and semi-independent means. As a matter of equity, this course aims to provide all graduate students with access to this knowledge.

# Queer Natures, Queer Lives
## Course Description
In fall 2023, Kew Gardens in London faced some unusual backlash against their annual autumn festival. Celebrating the “diversity of art, plants and fungi,” the Gardens chose the theme of “Queer Nature,” linking ecological biodiversity to the diversity of human gender and sexuality.

What can plants, animals, fungi, and other organisms contribute to queer theory and queer liberation? Is queer, trans, and nonbinary life natural? Does queerness have an evolutionary basis and function? Are nature and biology productive foundations or distractions for queer activism and critique? This course confronts these questions by considering the relationship between queer art, literature, and theory and scientific and other forms of knowledge production about the natural world. We’ll examine both rejections and celebrations of the idea of queerness as natural, along with feminist and queer of color revisions and deconstructions of distinctions between nature, culture, and technology and between the human and the nonhuman.

Artists and authors might include Karen Barad, Joshua Bennett, Octavia E. Butler, Charles Darwin, Samuel R. Delany, Anne Fausto-Sterling, Greta Gaard, Donna Haraway, Zakiyyah Iman Jackson, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Greta LaFleur, Daniel Lee, Melissa K. Nelson, Richard Prum, Isabella Rossellini, Catriona Sandilands, Sam See, Nicole Seymour, Banu Subramaniam, Kim Tallbear, and James Tiptree Jr.

# Asian American Literature On Campus
## Course Description
The category of "Asian American" has been closely associated with the college campus since coalitions of student activists demanded the formation of Asian American and other ethnic studies programs in the 1960s. At the same time, recent attacks on affirmative action have exposed how vexed the presence of Asian America on campus and in university curricula remains: are Asian Americans under- or over-represented in higher education? Is “Asian American” still a useful category, or does it obscure significant demographic and cultural diversity? Must the association between Asian Americans and higher education feed the model minority stereotype? This course considers the relationship between literature and the political and cultural category “Asian American” through canonical works of Asian American literature, fiction about Asian Americans on campus, and literature by college students and teachers. Authors may include Anne Anlin Cheng, Susan Choi, Mohsin Hamid, Cathy Park Hong, R.O. Kwon, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Jia Tolentino, Weike Wang, Karen Tei Yamashita, Jenny Zhang.

# Science, Technology, and Folklore

![Screenshot of a social media post by the American Folklore Society in 2020, reading "With the release of Taylor Swift’s new album, Folklore, many people are asking, what is folklore? Come learn about folklore and folklore studies at: http://whatisfolklore.org/"](/assets/images/teaching/american-folklore-society-swift.png)

## Course Description

Bringing together a [dying(?)](https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/v46/n01/folkclose.html) academic discipline and science, technology, and contemporary technoculture's speculative orientation toward the future, this course proposes **folklore** as an unlikely but powerful approach to the study of science, technology, and digital media.

Topics may include internet communities, cultures, subcultures, and countercultures; rhetorics of science and technology; technology hype; digital heritage and preservation; and models of technological change, and genres may include folk science, lay theories, academic gossip, rumor, hype, meme, myth, legend, and joke.
