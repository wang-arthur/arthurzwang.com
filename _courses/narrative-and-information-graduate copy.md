Can literature make sense of modern information? This course examines
the fates and functions of narrative in Anglophone information
societies. While the rise of information technology might threaten to
flatten knowledge and storytelling into data and content, we examine how
narrative forms (principally the novel, short story, and life writing)
and narrative theories have long incorporated, revised, and resisted
information theory, informational media (including and beyond the
digital), and information economies. Along with narrative theory, this
seminar introduces students to science and technology studies,
communication and media studies, and book history.

# Assignments

Assignments in this seminar are designed to equip graduate students with
some of the essential skills for successful academic research, writing,
and professionalization. Regardless of whether the subject of this
course ends up being relevant for your future work, you will complete
the course with concrete and portable skills in:

-    **Communication and Collegiality**: giving and receiving written and
    oral feedback (formulating comments that are rigorous, helpful, and
    generous; handling and incorporating critiques and suggestions about
    your work); asking good questions.
-    **Organization**: taking useful notes; building a system for
    managing, retrieving, and connecting fragmentary ideas, sources, and
    quotations; not repeating/losing work to a black hole of
    disorganization and distraction in our attention economy
-    **Speculation**: crafting a compelling proposal for a project before
    you've actually completed the work; establishing preliminary
    questions, stakes, and interventions with only partial knowledge.
-    **Writing**: practice writing in a professional genre; reading
    academic writing for form and craft. Instead of completing a
    conventional seminar paper with an audience of one (me), you will
    select a major academic genre, review models and guides, and
    complete either a full draft or partial draft with a plan for future
    revision and completion. (It's not possible/plausible to write a
    strong journal article draft in a semester while completing multiple
    seminar papers; more productive to write a partial draft with a plan
    for future revision and completion. For shorter forms, like
    conference presentations, proposals for a conference
    panel/roundtable/workshop or journal special issue, we will
    discuss.)

The four skills above correspond to the graded components of the
seminar:

# Notetaking System

An exercise in literary and scholarly information management.

This assignment is an opportunity to develop a clear, effective system
for taking notes and managing references, quotations, and ideas (or to
refine your system, if you already have one). While you are only
required to use this notetaking system to organize materials for this
class, you should develop a system that you could realistically use for
substantially larger-scale and longer-term projects (like articles,
chapters, dissertations, or books).

I will suggest or introduce various models, systems, and software (e.g.,
notetaking software like Notion, Obsidian, OneNote, Evernote, Apple
Notes, or Scrivener; the Zettelkasten method; and citation management
software like Zotero, Mendeley, and Endnote). However, you may use any
system that works for you, including non-digital/pen-and-paper options.
At the end of the semester, you will share your notes with me, along
with a brief, informal description (2-3 pages) about how and why you've
organized your notes & how you plan to use this system going forward.

For some preliminary inspiration, please see my [Commonplace Book
Assignment](https://arthurzwang.com/teaching/materials/commonplace-book-assignment)
for information and examples from an undergraduate-level version of this
assignment.
