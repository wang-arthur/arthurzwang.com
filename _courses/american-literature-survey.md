*Draft/Sample Syllabus, Undergraduate Survey of American Literature 1865-present*

Description
===========

This course surveys American Literature from the end of the Civil War to
the present, with a particular focus on innovations in literary form as
interventions in social, cultural, political, and technological change.
In addition to introducing students to major periods, movements, genres,
and diverse authors in modern and contemporary American literature, the
course will also foreground how literary works from the past 160 years
revise and complicate boundaries between the US and the world; major and
minor; citizens and foreigners; culture and politics; literary genres;
literature and other arts and media; and art and life.

=====

-   *The Norton Anthology of American Literature, Volume II: 1865 to the
    Present*, shorter ninth edition, ed. Michael A. Elliott, Mary
    Loeffelholz, and Amy Hungerford (W. W. Norton & Company, 2017).

Papers
------

Instructions for papers will be distributed well in advance of the due

section leader, according to their policies for late work. Otherwise,
late work will be marked down 1/3 of a grade every 24 hours and will not
be accepted after one week. I will work with the section leaders to
establish fair grading standards, so grades are not negotiable unless
we've made a calculation error.

**\[Academic integrity policy & generative AI policy\]**

Exam
----

The final exam for the course will cover material from lectures and
readings. The exam will primarily consist of passage identification &
brief descriptions of their significance in American literary history.
The exam will also include a short essay as an exercise in synthesizing
your formal, historical, and/or theoretical observations about multiple
texts into coherent and cogent analysis. I will provide sample/practice
questions in advance and section leaders will conduct a review session
at the end of the term.

Attendance and Participation
----------------------------

Attendance is crucial for both lectures and sections. If you must miss a
class, please notify your section leader and consult a classmate's
notes. You may miss up to two section meetings with no questions asked,
but further absences will lower your grade.

Participation includes thorough preparation and active contributions to
section discussions. Contributing to section discussions involves not
only speaking thoughtfully, but also listening carefully and
contributing to a balanced, dynamic, and collaborative conversation
(i.e., refraining from dominating or derailing discussions). Please do
not use electronic devices in ways that might distract you or those
around you (e.g., by doing anything other than note-taking and
occasional internet searches).

If you find yourself struggling to join the conversation or feeling
uncomfortable with the class dynamic for any reason, please let me or
your section leader know. I can help, and if relevant, connect you with
further resources and support.

Inclusion and Accessibility
---------------------------

I am committed to making this class accessible to students of all
backgrounds and aim to adhere to principles of [Universal Design for
Learning](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/). Some topics and readings
from the course, particularly those related to violence and
discrimination, may be uncomfortable or disturbing; some level of
discomfort is necessary and productive for intellectual growth, and in
section discussions, students should feel empowered to try out ideas,
disagree, and revise their positions in a respectful environment.

If your work for this class requires special arrangements because of
disability, please contact \[Disability Services Office\] as soon as
possible. If relevant, please also reach out to me and/or your section
leader if there are additional adjustments that might improve your
ability to participate fully in the course but might fall outside \[the
Disability Services Office\]'s scope.

Office Hours and Course Communications
