I am a scholar of contemporary fiction, media, and feminist science and technology studies, focusing on how scientific concepts travel across contexts and assert universal applicability. 

My current book project, _Minor Theories of Everything_, is an interdisciplinary inquiry into the proliferation and propagation of scientific universalisms about human sociality since the 20th century, and their surprising uptake by feminists and writers of color. I published [an article](/publication/game-theory-of-sex) drawn from this project in *American Literature*.

My second book project, _Making Scientific Lives_, investigates the co-formation of biographical media and the modern sciences, and traces tensions between ideals of scientific impersonality and the circulation of scientistsâ€™ life stories in academic and popular cultures. 

Currently a Provost's Postdoctoral Fellow at UPenn's Annenberg School for Communication, I received a Ph.D. in English from Yale University and before graduate school, worked as a software engineer at Datadog. With Annie McClanahan, I co-edit [*Post45 Journal*](https://post45.org/journal), a diamond open-access peer-reviewed publication.
