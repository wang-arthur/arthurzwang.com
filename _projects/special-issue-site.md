# Project Overview
## Three Anecdotes about Special Issues

1.  When I began a literature PhD program in 2015 after a couple years
    working in tech, it seemed like every lecture and seminar I attended
    introduced some unfamiliar combination of words, a phrase whose
    meaning I could not fully discern from its constituent parts:
    "surface reading"; "race and/as technology"; "queer
    temporality."[^1] These powerful concepts and others originate in
    special issues of humanities journals and circulate as critical
    keywords, shorthand, and shibboleths in scholarly conversations,
    often as common coin without citation or explanatory context. In
    some cases, as with "Afrofuturism" (coined in a special issue of
    *South Atlantic Quarterly,* "Flame Wars: The Discourse of
    Cyberculture" edited by Mark Dery and expanded and publicized in a
    special issue of *Social Text* on Afrofuturism edited by Alondra
    Nelson), the terms move far beyond the academy. Despite their
    significance, special issues are difficult to search for and
    discover using existing databases.

2.  Earlier this year, I received an email notification about a newly
    published special issue of *American Literature* on "Critical AI: A
    Field in Formation." This publication announcement was the first I'd
    heard of the issue, though I'd been working on an article related to
    the topic. I'm privileged to have access to various academic
    networks and organizations, and I also follow the journal closely, but even with these access points, I was caught unaware of the special
    issue until it was already published.

3.  While compiling submissions data for *Post45 Journal*, an open-access
    peer-reviewed journal I now co-edit, I found a troubling gulf
    between the journal's historical acceptance rates for single
    articles and articles appearing in special issues. Although some gap between these rates might be justifiable (or
    at least explainable) due to varying demographics and circumstances
    of submission (authors in special issues tend to be more senior;
    they also receive more thorough pre-peer review editing by guest
    editors), those explanations seem insufficient. The idea that
    articles reviewed for special issues are simply higher in quality
    strikes me as implausible or incomplete, and I suspect that the
    acceptance rate gap reproduces or amplifies inequalities associated
    with opportunities and resources for professional networking and
    access to secure employment. Though the journal, in principle,
    treats all peer-reviewed articles the same way, all review processes
    also include discretionary elements for editorial judgment.*[^2]


## Need

The scholarly frictions I sketch above are common but represent only a
small subset of the challenges that researchers of all kinds---from
undergraduate students to senior professors, independent scholars,
writers, and journalists---encounter in attempting to engage with
scholarly publications and special issues in the humanities using
library resources. Despite the academic and broader cultural importance
of themed special issues in the humanities for establishing conceptual
shifts, convening major conversations, and advancing significant
debates, special issues remain relatively opaque. They are
inconsistently and spottily indexed in databases, rarely listed on
journal websites, and often incompletely enumerated even when they do
appear. The policies, procedures, and histories about their assembly,
formations, and contexts are overwhelmingly obscured and inaccessible.

As a result, students and scholars currently have few options for
accessing and understanding special issues. There's no clear or simple
way to assemble answers to basic questions about special issues in a
single journal's history, let alone across a topic, subfield, or
discipline. The three anecdotes above illustrate three problems with the
structure of information about special issues in the humanities:

1.  Post-publication, they are challenging to access and discover for
    students, readers, and researchers.

2.  Their calls for papers are scattered and poorly publicized.

3.  Their review processes and compilation (whether submissions are
    closed/invitation-only or open to all) can compound inequities and
    amplify gaps in privilege and prestige.

To demonstrate the first problem with an example, what if a student of
American literature wanted to find out what special issues *American
Literature* has published, or even just how many? Here are the steps I
took to compile a list before giving up (for now):

-   On [the journal's JSTOR
    page](https://www.jstor.org/journal/amerlite), special issues are
    labeled, but coverage is incomplete (limited to the first 71 years
    of the journal and missing the past 25 years). Five special issues
    are listed on this page. The preface to the earliest one indicates
    that "Subjects and Citizens: Nation, Race, and Gender from Oroonoko
    to Anita Hill" (volume 65, no. 3 (1993)) was "the first special
    issue in the sixty-five-year history of *American Literature*";
    without this lucky break, I would not have been certain if it was
    the first special issue or only the first special issue listed on
    the site (413). Browsing more issues, however, reveals that
    *American Literature* had previously published themed
    *forums*---special sections that make up only part of an issue and
    that aren't listed on the journal site. The issue immediately
    preceding the "first special issue" of the journal contains one of
    these themed forums, on the question, "What Do We Need to Teach?"
    (66, no. 3 (1994): 325-361).

-   The Duke University Press [page for *American
    Literature*](https://dukeupress.edu/american-literature#BuyAnIssue)
    complements JSTOR's collection, including only special issues
    since 2000. While the site includes [tables of
    contents](https://read.dukeupress.edu/american-literature/issue) for
    these recent issues, manually browsing each of the approximately 100
    issues since 2000 is the only way to compile a list of special
    issues and special sections in that period. On the Duke UP main page
    for the journal, several special issues appear under the heading
    "Buy An Issue," but the earliest one in the list is from 2008, and
    the list omits, for example, volume 92, no. 4 (2020), which contains
    "COVID-19 Forum: Pandemic Reading," a special section that makes up
    the majority of the issue (alongside two one-off articles and
    several book reviews).

-   The MLA International Bibliography, the definitive database for
    publications in languages and literatures, indexes special
    issues---but not with publication type metadata. Instead, special
    issues are listed as "Journal Articles" that simply have "\[Special
    Issue\]" appended to the title field. Searching "articles" in
    *American Literature* with "special issue" in the title field
    between 1993-2024 yields only 14 results, with the earliest in 2011
    (leaving out all the special issues in the 1990s and 2000s).

As this lengthy chronicle demonstrates, special issues are unreasonably
difficult to collate and trace even in a leading, well-indexed literary
studies journal.

### Opacity of Special Issue Publishing and History

- Journals are rarely transparent about how special issues are assembled. Were some or all of the authors invited to submit by guest editors? Was there an open CFP for the special issue? It's often unclear whether journals are even open to unsolicited special issue proposals.
- Even well-connected scholars can miss CFP announcements, which are distributed unevenly across a variety of platforms and modes: individual journal websites, publisher websites, word-of-mouth, direct invitations, forwarded emails, social media, and various CFP websites (some of which are difficult to navigate)
- Information about published special issues is spotty and decentralized. Many journal and publisher websites don't have full lists of special issues. Even full-text databases are missing consistent tagging and metadata on special issues. Finding quick answers to basic queries about special issues is usually infeasible (for example, what special issues in field X or related to topic Y have been published in the past Z years?). See also [Open but not Discoverable](/talks/2024-price-lab), notes for a talk on some of these issues that I presented at the Price Lab for Digital Humanities.


The situation is not much better for upcoming special issues. Calls for
Papers (CFPs) for special issues-in-development are also difficult to
access and locate (and consequently, for those looking back, it becomes
unclear which published special issues were assembled through open CFPs
vs. by invitation through insider networks). CFPs for special issues
appear in various locations, none of which are definitive, and many of
which are challenging to navigate. Perhaps the largest host for calls
for papers in the discipline of English/Anglophone literary studies is
the [Penn CFP (Calls for Papers)
site](https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/). Though a valuable
resource, this site has major issues: the search function is a wrapper
for a Google search, which allows for extremely limited sorting and
filtering via keyword search. Because the site also includes CFPs for
conferences, fellowships, and prizes, and the journal category is lumped
together with anthologies and edited collection books, there's no simple
way to view only special issue CFPs, let alone filter out irrelevant
ones. The site does not allow sorting by deadline and or filtering by
field, area, topic, or selected journals. It has been a useful and
important resource in my field, but a limited and not particularly
usable one. Other alternatives (like [MLA Profession
CFPs](https://profession.mla.org/cfps/);
[journal](https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/asapjournal?srsltid=AfmBOooKV_HTEBLQ2r_ajqgEwoTEyXK8Oi2MsVouWijfTrU3yIhQmhLv),
publisher, and [scholarly organization
websites](https://www.acla.org/resources-links/calls-papers); listservs;
[announcements on social
media](https://x.com/search?q=special%20issue%20cfp); word-of mouth;
direct/closed personal invitations; and scholarly communities/social
networks like
[H-Net](https://networks.h-net.org/group/pages/20001709/call) and [MLA
Commons](https://mla.hcommons.org/forums/topic-tag/cfp/)) are even more
limited in scope, coverage, accessibility, and functionality. This lack
of transparency around special issue CFPs disproportionately
disadvantages junior and minoritized scholars, who may have less access
to the scholarly networks in which special issue CFPs and private
invitations circulate.

As the third problem I list above suggests, uneven access to publishing
in special issues is an equity problem, as special issues are
advantageous to humanities scholars for several reasons.

### Benefits of Publishing in Special Issues

- Potentially larger audiences and greater impact
- Participation can lead to other opportunities, like invitations to give talks, join panels, and participate in workshops
- Higher acceptance rates. To be clear, a higher acceptance rate for special issues does not imply lower quality or relaxed standards, and could result from various factors (some of which I outline in the bullet points below). I believe that discrepancies between special issue and regular acceptance rates are a major equity issue & likely common among leading journals (we certainly have this problem at *Post45*), but I suspect that they typically result from bias and structural issues rather than active impropriety. Either way, we need to address the problem.
  - Journal editors might approach articles more generously or with positive expectations, viewing the articles as already having been vetted by guest editors
  - Journals may follow different processes for special issues and one-off articles
  - Guest editors often provide developmental editing and mentoring before submission, so special issue articles may be more polished or immediately legible to reviewers
  - Guest editors might advocate for their authors in conversations with journal editors, helping to tip the balance in ambiguous or borderline cases (even with double-anonymous peer review, journal editors have a great deal of latitude and discretion, e.g., in desk review and adjudicating split decisions between reviewers).
  - Even if guest editors exert no influence, journal editors may be biased toward acceptance. After approving a special issue proposal & investing time and effort into the project, no one wants a special issue to fall through. However, leading humanities journals often boast low acceptance rates (frequently under 20% and sometimes under 10%); if special issues actually hewed to those accepetance rates, they'd frequently be left with too few articles.
  - Special issue contributors are not a representative sample of the profession

### Barriers to Publishing in Special Issues
- Some are closed / invitation only
- Poorly circulated information, even with open CFPs
- Special issues may be linked to events with open CFPs (like conference panels or roundtables), but later close to new contributors
- The process of assembling special issues may exacerbate inequalities by favoring scholars:
  - with resources to build extensive networks (e.g., time, stable employment, funding, and personal circumstances that allow for frequent travel and conference attendance)
  - with well-connected advisors/mentors/colleagues
  - affiliated with prestigious institutions
  - who are senior and/or already have strong reputations 


## Purpose

Using modern web technologies, I plan to create a definitive, centralized, and
well-structured digital repository of open calls for papers and
historical metadata about journal special issues in the humanities, in
the form of a website/web application.

After the planning phase of the project, I will seek funding to hire
and mentor student research assistants to conduct a complete survey of
special issue metadata for major Anglophone literary studies and media studies journals
(with a principle of selection informed by multiple resources, including
authoritative sources like the [MLA Directory of Periodicals](https://www.mla.org/Publications/MLA-International-Bibliography/About-the-MLA-International-Bibliography/MLA-Directory-of-Periodicals) and [SCMS](https://www.cmstudies.org/page/resources_journals),
crowdsourced data like the [Humanities Journal
Wiki](https://humanitiesjournals.fandom.com/wiki/Literary_Studies_Journals),
and discussions with scholars and librarians).

At the same time, I will also develop a first public version of a web
application that will be useful for humanities researchers at all levels.
The site will be live and available online with open-source code as soon
as a basic version is ready, and research assistants and I will work
iteratively to add new features and improvements to the site (in
software engineering lingo, via continuous integration) and incorporate data
as we collect it (both manually and automatically through web crawlers).
We will then launch the site and publicize it
widely as a research resource to accompany and complement library
databases, make scholarly conversations more approachable, and help
academics discover opportunities for scholarly publication.

## Audience

This project will initially focus on academic journals in literature and media studies, and the potential audience
includes a substantial and diverse group of researchers, including high-school students and teachers
working on fundamental research and writing skills; undergraduate
students taking humanities courses and conducting
independent research; graduate students completing coursework, presenting at conferences, and
beginning to publish articles and reviews; writers, literary critics, and book
reviewers; and professors, lecturers, and independent and contingent humanities
scholars. Future iterations of the project will expand to other fields
in the humanities, arts, and humanistic social sciences.[^4]

Possible use cases for this web application include:
-   Answering basic questions about journal publication history.
-   Familiarizing oneself with new fields (for example, as a graduate
    student or an interdisciplinary scholar engaging with research areas
    beyond one's formal training).
-   Assessing and demonstrating the existence of scholarly interest in
    topics or questions, for persuasive academic genres like
    dissertation prospectuses and introductions, book proposals, and
    grant applications.
-   Surveying scholarly conversations to establish context when writing
    in various genres, including seminar papers, articles, conference
    presentations, dissertations, prospectuses, proposals, and
    fellowship applications.
-   Researching and understanding disciplinary history, including by
    gaining a sense of scholarly social and professional networks and
    journals' editorial preoccupations, interests, and characters.
-   Familiarizing oneself with journals' publication standards,
    procedures, and styles, for instance, in preparation to pitch a
    special issue.

## Project Director

I am a Provost's Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's
Annenberg School for Communication and an affiliate fellow in the Penn
Program on Race, Science, and Society. Before beginning this role, I
completed a Ph.D. in English at Yale University with the support of a
2021-2022 Diversity Predoctoral Fellowship in Women's and Gender Studies
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My scholarship focuses on
intersections of contemporary American literary, media, and feminist
science and technology studies, with a strong basis in archival
research. I currently work as an academic journal editor for the
open-access literary studies journal, [*Post45
Journal*](https://post45.org) and Technology and Open Access Officer and
a member of the board of directors of its parent organization. My
scholarship has immersed me in the academic genres and
social life of journal publishing, and has equipped me to critically
examine dynamics of scholarly communication and media across
disciplines. I also worked as a professional software engineer prior to
graduate school, and have kept these skills sharp and current, in part
through my work with Post45 to develop its WordPress theme
to enable the publication of journal special issues and themed
forums/clusters in the journal's sibling publication, *[Post45:
Contemporaries](https://post45.org/contemporaries)* (see figure below).
Six years of experience in journal publishing and a background in web development
prepare me to conceptualize, design, and execute robust, scalable, and
maintainable open-source web applications using modern technologies, metadata standards, 
and design patterns according to best practices.



[^1]: Sharon Marcus and Stephen Best with Emily Apter and Elaine
    Freedgood, eds., "The Way We Read Now," special issue,
    *Representations* 108 (2009); Wendy Hyu Kyong Chun and Lynne
    Joyrich, eds., "Race and/as Technology," special issue, *Camera
    Obscura* 70 (2009); Elizabeth Freeman, "Queer Temporalities,"
    special issue, *GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies* 13, no.
    2-3 (2007). Although these special issues are some of the best known
    in my field from the past twenty years, generating these citations
    was not straightforward. Scholars often cite the Stephen Best and
    Sharon Marcus's introduction, "Surface Reading: An Introduction,"
    leaving out Emily Apter and Elaine Freedgood (and introduction
    authors are listed in reverse order compared to the issue editors).
    With Chun and Joyrich's special issue, the cover image does not list
    the editors and the printed table of contents is not available on
    the [Duke UP page for the
    issue](https://read.dukeupress.edu/camera-obscura/issue/24/1%20(70)).
    Although Chun is usually associated/credited with "race as
    technology" due to her sole authorship of the issue's introduction,
    Joyrich wrote a preface and I confirmed by checking her CV that she
    was co-editor of the issue. Furthermore, I typically use Zotero to
    organize my citations, but in this case, I had to generate the
    citation manually by referring to the Chicago Manual of Style (which
    includes citation formats for special issues and articles in special
    issues), as Zotero has no metadata format for special issues. There
    is no "special issue" or "issue" item type, nor is there a field in
    the journal article item type to indicate a source's belonging to a
    special issue.\
    \
    While these citation concerns might seem like minor obstacles, mere
    annoyances, they seem to result in scholars primarily citing special
    issue introductions but only referring generally to special issues,
    which can erase, distort, or obscure the substasntial intellectual
    work of editing. For reference, I have included without modification
    below the Zotero-generated citations for the introductions of each
    of my example special issues:

    Stephen Best and Sharon Marcus, "Surface Reading: An Introduction,"
    *Representations* 108, no. 1 (2009): 1--21,
    https://doi.org/10.1525/rep.2009.108.1.1; Wendy Hui Kyong Chun,
    "Introduction: Race and/as Technology; or, How to Do Things to
    Race," *Camera Obscura: Feminism, Culture, and Media Studies* 24,
    no. 1 (70) (May 1, 2009): 7--35,
    https://doi.org/10.1215/02705346-2008-013; Elizabeth Freeman,
    "Introduction," *GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies* 13, no.
    2--3 (June 1, 2007): 159--76,
    https://doi.org/10.1215/10642684-2006-029.

[^2]: Some examples of editorial discretion in anonymous peer review:
    *we anonymize submissions for reviewers but not ourselves; we make
    judgment calls during desk review and interpret reader's reports
    when they come back with split decisions or borderline
    recommendations (e.g., "I recommend either a revision and
    resubmission or acceptance pending substantial revision"); and for
    special issues, we collaborate closely with guest editors, who tend
    to hold biases toward acceptance and publication, as their authors
    may be friends and colleagues and they have already approved and
    endorsed the work. The collaborative process between journal and
    guest editors can exert subtle or explicit pressure on journal
    editors to lean toward accepting special issue articles or at least
    giving them the benefit of the doubt. My point is not that special
    issues are illegitimate or lower quality (my own journal exclusively
    publishes special issues, along with one-off articles), but rather,
    that their formation is opaque and perhaps unfairly advantageous for
    authors.*

[^3]: I am not, of course, the first to think about academic forms and
    genres in relation to disciplinary history, accessibility, and
    equity. An upcoming special issue of *Postmodern Culture*, "The
    Forms of Academic Work," aims ([according to its
    CFP](https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/cfp/2023/08/21/the-forms-of-academic-work))
    to "think through the ways in which the forms we do academic work in
    structure that work...for all their centrality, there's not been
    much discussion of what academic forms...let alone much
    consideration of whether they need to be what they are, or what they
    might be in the future." The timing of this special issue (deadline
    for submissions was fall 2023) might indicate that humanities
    scholars are eager to reconsider the forms and genres we typically
    take for granted.

[^4]: Special issues and, more broadly, the scale and contours of
    journal publishing industry in the natural and life sciences, differ
    substantially enough from humanities journals that I do not plan to
    include them in this project. E.g., in a now-deleted post on
    X/Twitter, a medical school professor described special issues as a
    tool of predatory publishers, offering no advantages and several
    disadvantages to junior scholars -- he may have deleted this due to
    push-back from scholars in fields where special issues are important
    and advantageous, particularly for junior scholars. However, the
    software will be open source, which would enable others to create
    and populate their own versions with metadata for other fields.


# Draft Work Plan

The team for the duration of this project will include me and two
research assistants. I will focus on designing and developing the
website/web application, while research assistants collect data
about special issues. One research assistant (RA) will focus on print
journal issues and manual data collection. The other RA will program
scripts/web crawlers to automate the collection/compilation and update
process for data from disparate public sources of information about
special issues (including various CFP listings and listservs, journal
and publisher websites and eTOC updates). This data will be made
available continuously, once validated.

RAs might assist with contacting journal editors to
create a resource guide for special issue proposal policies (noting, for example,
which journals accept unsolicited special issue proposals, whether they
accept them anytime (like [*Post45
Journal*](https://post45.org/contact-us/)) or only during an annual
window (like [*Comparative
Literature*](https://read.dukeupress.edu/comparative-literature/pages/Submission_Guidelines),
which reviews proposals only in late spring), and how long their
publication timeline extends, ideally including both review timelines
and lag between acceptance and publication, which can be lengthy if
journals have large backlogs).

## Tasks
### Completed

Created a preliminary test/sketch/demo application/rapid
prototype to experiment with compiling and visualizing special
issue information and to practice using D3.js, a popular
JavaScript library for creating interactive data visualizations.

### Future

**Stage 1**
- Apply for small grants for project funding
- Hire and train research assistants to collect special issue
    data. Assistants will prioritize a subset of leading literary
    studies journals at first, with more to follow.
- Complete review of existing "competition" (existing sources
    of information about past special issues & open calls for
    papers) and conduct brief user interviews with a range of
    researchers to make decisions about the site's design, data
    model, technology stack, metadata standards, and use cases of
    the web application.
-  Program and release a first public version of the web
    application with a robust data set and core features, including:
    -   Simple and effective interfaces for browsing, searching,
        sorting, and filtering of CFPs and published special issues
    -   forms for users to submit and publicize CFPs
    -   admin backend for reviewing and approving user-submitted
        CFPs and admin backend for populating the site with special
        issue information we've collected
    -   guidelines and procedures for open-source contributions and
        credit (and outreach to digital humanities and MLIS programs
        to recruit potential open-source volunteers)
-   Site will be public and code will be open access from the
    beginning to enable feedback and testing, but the project will
    not be broadly publicized until a full working version is
    complete.
-   Launch and publicize the site
    -   Include plans for future development and features to come
    -   Also include info / demos about use cases along with
        resources like a guide to developing a special issue
        proposal that compiles policies -- these materials will be
        helpful resources in themselves, but will also double as
        marketing material helping to publicize the site.

**Stage 2**
-   Prepare applications/proposals for major
    grants to sustain and expand the site (covering more journals
    and disciplines, developing more robust features)
    -   One aspect of this work will be exploring ways to sustain
        the site beyond the funding periods. Another aspect will involve
        developing an "exit plan" that is faithful to best
        practices in open-source software development. 
  
        *Aside: In my view,
        the spirit of FOSS (free and open-source software) requires
        not only that code be made freely and publicly available and
        licensed for reuse (though those are the most important
        criteria), but also advance planning to avoid software rot,
        disappearance, and other forms of inaccessibility (whether
        intended or not). I will plan thoroughly to ensure that even
        if I am unable to secure funding to sustain and support the
        site, it will not automatically become "abandonware" --
        there will be clear mechanisms, documentation, and
        procedures in place so others can use, repurpose, or revive
        the project. Even if the project itself becomes obscure and
        obsolete, I will have a plan in place to publicize a
        "postmortem" so others can learn from the project's failures
        and mistakes. In my experience, this planning is not
        typically a part of the proposal process for major grants,
        but given the substantial scale of public/philanthropic
        investment required for digital humanities/software
        projects, it absolutely should be.*
-   Continue adding site features
    -   Information about journal policies
    -   Wiki-like version history and version control for
        user-submitted data
    -   User profiles and settings (e.g., favorite journals for
        quick filtering and email update notifications)
    -   Data export / download / API

**Stage 3**
-   Seek an institutional host or a financial model for developing and
    sustaining the application (such as sponsorships from libraries
    and publishers or acquisition and hosting by a scholarly
    organization, an academic department or center, or a research
    library).
-   Release further iterations of the web application to add
    features like citation graphs, visualizations, and more
    sophisticated tools for browsing, discovery, and research.

**Other Tasks**
-   Organize and edit a journal special issue on the influence,
    history, biases, and social lives of themed journal issues in
    literary studies. Write an introduction, assemble a group of
    authors, and convene a workshop or conference panel to develop
    this collaborative volume.
-   Compose principles and best practices for editing and reviewing
    special issues and special issue articles equitably, perhaps in
    collaboration with the Council of Editors of Learned Journals
    (CELJ)
-   Outreach to editors and publishers with invitations to
    contribute data and information about their journals and special

# Site Features (in progress)

- Multiple sources of data
  - submissions from publishers, editors, and other scholars
  - web crawlers to collect data that's already public but scattered
  - manual upload, direct requests to journals and publishers
- User accounts/profiles
  - Subscribe for CFP updates (filtered)
  - Contribute data
- Open source and open data
  - The site code will be publicly available & licensed for reuse and data (all data aside from user data?) will be accessible and exportable.
  - Resilient: even if the site goes defunct, others can restart it / create an identical copy
  - Extensibility: the focus for this resource will be humanistic, but folks from other fields could build on the project and create versions for their disciplines

## Primary interfaces
- CFP browser: easy to filter, search, sort, and otherwise discover relevant CFPs
- Journal info pages: see a given journal's policies for special issue submission, open CFPs, and past special issues 
- Historical special issue database
  - comprehensive information about published special issues, including robust metadata
  - Combined with CFP data, this database could also provide transparency around the formation of special issue; there'll be a public source of info about how special issue X was formed (via open CFP or by invitation only? initiated by the journal's staff or an outside proposal? associated with particular events, conferences, or meetings?)
