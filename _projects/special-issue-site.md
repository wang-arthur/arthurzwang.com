# Sketch
A [toy app](https://wang-arthur.github.io/special-issues/) I completed in October 2022 to learn D3.js (a popular data visualization library) and experiment with special issue metadata formatting. Note: I worked on this for less than two weeks; the completed app won't look or function anything like this. This was just a helpful exercise in compiling and structuring special issue data.
