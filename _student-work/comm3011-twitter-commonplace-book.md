<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Receptive.<br>&quot;Memories are not owned by groups... Rather, the borders of memory and identity are<br>jagged; what looks at first like my own property often turns out to be a borrowing or adaptation from a history that initially might seem foreign or distant.&quot; (Rothberg, 2009)</p>&mdash; Death and Destruction of Self (@MortalityAnd_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalityAnd_/status/1722478635268128949?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wishfulness.<br>&quot;It is tempting to fill in the gaps and to provide closure where there is none.&quot; (Hartman) I wish more historians resisted this temptation. The dead fill archives with beautiful stories of Indigenous power, trans joy, and Black resistance. It&#39;s there if you look.</p>&mdash; Death and Destruction of Self (@MortalityAnd_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalityAnd_/status/1719908363910144429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Curious<br>Today we talked about Swedish Death Cleaning and the DSM-5. Apparently, they consider hoarding as a disorder. I wonder at what point is it just &quot;clutter&quot; and when does it become &quot;hoarding&quot;? Is it only when piles of things are nearly reaching the ceiling?</p>&mdash; Death and Destruction of Self (@MortalityAnd_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalityAnd_/status/1709387121235304909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Frustrated.<br>&quot;Clinicians default to a full code—CPR, intubation, and IV drugs—even if the patient doesn’t want it.&quot; (Piemonte) It&#39;s horrible to think about how quickly and automatically a patient&#39;s wishes can be disregarded by medical staff in a hospital.</p>&mdash; Death and Destruction of Self (@MortalityAnd_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MortalityAnd_/status/1706532610913296819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
