Originally assigned in COMM 3011: "[Media, Medicine, and the Arts of Mortality](/teaching/2023-media-medicine-arts-mortality)" (Fall 2023) at the Annenberg School for Communication

# Description

The final assignment for this course is a **public humanities media
production project **with a **research-based argument about media and
death** in a form/medium other than a conventional academic essay.

You can think of **public humanities** as humanistic scholarship for
not-just-academic audiences. Traditional academic scholarship tends to
happen at universities and get disseminated in scholarly journals and
books. Public humanities attempts not just to supplement these formats,
but to decenter them and expand the range of venues and media for
scholarly work. So, public humanities isn\'t just an add-on to
conventional scholarship, a translation, simplification, watering down,
or afterthought. As Evan Carton, founder of the University of Texas
Humanities Institute [puts it](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/humanitiesinstitute/), "Public
humanities is about finding both practical and conceptual locations,
spaces, and translations between the various kinds of humanities work
that people are doing.\" In other words, public humanities broadens our
recognition of what counts as scholarly work; connects humanistic work
at universities with the efforts of other organizations, institutions,
and communities; and spans various media.

The format of your project is open ended. You will choose your own
topic, formulate a research question, develop an argument, and create
something in a medium of your choice. You can work by yourself or in
groups of 2-3. Don\'t worry if you\'re not immediately sure what to do!
We\'ll work on this project in stages throughout the semester: in class,
through short assignments, and in individual meetings.

# Possible formats

These are just suggestions. Please reach out if you have other ideas!
Note, however, that the assignment isn\'t completely open. While
creativity is encouraged, this is not a \"creative\" exercise (a work of
fiction, poetry, visual art, music, or a play), but a
critical/analytical project.

    -   a review (or a series of reviews) of one or more books, films,
        television shows, or art exhibitions
    -   You can find good examples of these genres in publications

        LOGIC, *and *n+1*. 
-   Documentary short film or video essay
-   Social media, any platform
    -   I will collect some examples of public humanities work on social
        media. For now, you might check out Alok\'s [book reports](https://web.whatsapp.com/) on Instagram
        (although they\'re more summary than research/argument)
        and [Eric Cervini](https://www.tiktok.com/@ericcervini?_t=8fdKpq3qlhu&_r=1)\'s
        book reviews on TikTok (both creators focus on LGBTQ history,
        theory, and culture).

-   Oral history
    -   [Voice of Witness](https://voiceofwitness.org/) has some great resources on
        conducting oral histories with marginalized narrators

# Questions to consider

-   What audience(s) do you want to reach? (should be more focused than
    \"everyone\" and broader than \"people in this class.\")
-   What media production skills might be most useful for your future
    academic work, career, or other activities and interests? What
    skills do you already have?
-   What are the characteristics, affordances, and limitations of
    different media and how might they shape the work you\'re trying to
    do? At a very basic level, for example, do you think a project on
    your topic should have a visual component? If your project involves
    talking to or interviewing people, how important is it for the
    audience to hear their voice (vs. read their words) and/or see them
    speaking?
-   What can a public humanities project accomplish that a conventional
    academic essay can\'t? Daniel Fisher names [five goals for publicly
    engaged humanities](https://humanitiesforall.org/essays/goals-of-the-publicly-engaged-humanities).
    Does your project fit into any of these categories? A different one?

{% capture goals %}
1.  Informing Contemporary Debates
2.  Amplifying Community Voices and Histories
3.  Helping Individuals and Communities Navigate Difficult
    Experiences
4.  Expanding Educational Access
5.  Preserving Culture in Times of Crisis and Change

# Parameters, Workload, and Grading

The intellectual work of this project for each student should be roughly
equivalent to that of a 10-12 page research paper (i.e., group projects
should be longer, larger and/or more ambitious than individual ones).
Each member of a group will be graded individually, and should submit a
1-2 page explanation of their contribution to their project.

(I know this is a bit vague, but parameters for projects are a bit more
difficult to quantify than essays. For example, how many minutes of
audio is equivalent to a 10-12 page paper? It\'s hard to say, because
the answer would depend on style and execution: a hastily-edited and
unfocused, rambling interview could go on for 90 minutes without
demonstrating much preparation or creativity, while a well-produced five
minute audio story could display a great deal of erudition,
thoughtfulness, and technical skill. I\'ll work with each student and
group individually to help you define an appropriate scope, scale, and
workload for your projects.)

If you choose a format that\'s new to you, please be aware that
production may take more time and energy than a conventional research
paper. For example, if you want to create a podcast segment but have
never edited audio before, learning how to do so will require a
substantial investment of time. If you have a more ambitious project
(ambitious in scale, length, or necessary technical skills), you might
want to consider forming a group. I\'m not a technical expert in media
production, but can direct you to help, resources, and equipment at
Penn, and will of course support you with project conceptualization,
research, and argument development as needed.

Regardless of medium, all projects will be evaluated based on the
following criteria. The project:

-   has a **clear and well-defined topic** with a reasonable scope.
-   is **research-based** and draws on 4-5 high-quality secondary
    sources beyond assigned course readings (you\'re very welcome to use
    assigned reading in addition to other sources you find). By
    \"high-quality,\" I mean that sources should be relevant, appear in
    a reputable venue (a good peer-reviewed journal or a well-designed
    public humanities project), and offer something constructive and
    helpful to your understanding of your topic and/or your methods for
    approaching the topic. If you find relevant but weak secondary
    sources on your topic (pieces you think are poorly written or
    ill-conceived), don\'t use them unless you have evidence that
    they\'re highly influential and need public correction (this is the
    scholarly version of not punching down). Group projects should draw
    on 6-10 secondary sources.
-   must present a **cogent argument**. Projects should aim for more
    than description or summary, and incorporate an interesting,
    arguable, non-obvious claim about the topic, grounded in sharp
    analysis and compelling **primary-source evidence**. Evidence can
    take many forms, including works of literature, films, television
    shows, commercials, advertisements, marketing materials, historical
    documents, speeches, videos, websites, mobile apps, and social media
    posts. You can also create/collect primary sources through
    techniques like interviews, focus groups, and photography.
-   should offer (or potentially offer) some **benefit, use, or value to
    its audience**. This could take many forms, including but not
    limited to Fisher\'s five goals pasted above.
-   should be **self-contained and complete**. It\'s wonderful if you
    want to do a project that\'s part of a larger and longer-term
    effort, but whatever you submit should make sense and stand on its
    own.
-   should include a **works cited/consulted** (my personal preference
    is the Chicago Manual of Style, but any format works). If it\'s not
    apparent in your project how you used these sources, please add a
    1-2 page explanation of how your research informed the design and
    execution of the project.
